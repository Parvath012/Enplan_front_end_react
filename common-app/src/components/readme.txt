The Common App serves as a centralized workspace that houses reusable and shared components used across multiple projects or modules within our system.

This promotes consistency, avoids code duplication, and makes maintenance easier.

note: If you're creating a new component that can or will be reused in more than one project, it must be added to the common-app/src/components folder.
